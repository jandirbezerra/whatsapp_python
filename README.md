PYTHON 3 LIBRARIES TO BE INSTALLED
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pathlib
pandas
os
re
datetime
wordcloud
matplotlib.pyplot
pathlib


INITIAL SETUP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Place below files in a specific folder:
   whatsapp_main.py
   whatsapp_functions.py

2) Create two subfolders. One called [Groups] and another called [Individuals].

Final folder look should be like this:
<root folder>
  |- <Groups>
  |- <Individuals>
  |- whatsapp_main.py
  |- whatsapp_functions.py


OBTAINING THE DATA
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Export whatsapp chat conversation, from a group or individual chat, without the
medias (photos, videos, etc) since these media files won't be trated.

Use your prefered method to send the file (Email, Cloud Service, Bluetooth, etc.)

Copy these files into the appropriate subfolder:
    Group conversation into Group folder.
    Individual conversation into Individual folder.

PROCESSING THE DATA
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unfurtunatly there is no magic button. You may run the entirely main script and it should work.
However, tweeks are necessary to change source, for example, since it can read multiple chat files.

In this version, executing step-by-step is the most accurate way.
In future versions, a more automated process may be released.

Have fun!
